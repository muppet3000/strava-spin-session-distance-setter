The script that I've written so far is very hacky and not a long term solution.

Instead, write a script that uses the REST API: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/accessing-user-data-via-the-strava-api-using-stravalib-d5bee7fdde17

The script should find any activity with a particular type of name e.g. Contains "Spinning" (case insensitive)

Then it should check that it currently has no distance set and then modify it accordingly.

This may need the same level of "hack" that was required for the XML one e.g. modify every heartbeat info rather than just setting a distance
